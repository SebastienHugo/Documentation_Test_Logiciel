# Behavior-driven development

Definition

Behaviour Driven Development (BDD) is a synthesis and refinement of practices stemming from Test Driven Development (TDD) and Acceptance Test Driven Development (ATDD). BDD augments TDD and ATDD with the following tactics:

-- Apply the "Five Why's" principle to each proposed user story, so that its purpose is clearly related to business outcomes

-- thinking "from the outside in", in other words implement only those behaviors which contribute most directly to these business outcomes, so as to minimize waste

-- describe behaviors in a single notation which is directly accessible to domain experts, testers and developers, so as to improve communication

-- apply these techniques all the way down to the lowest levels of abstraction of the software, paying particular attention to the distribution of behavior, so that evolution remains cheap
